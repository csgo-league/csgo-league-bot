## Setup (Linux)
1. First you must have a bot instance to run this script on. Follow the discord.py tutorial [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html) on how to set one up. Be sure to invite it to a server to use it.

   * The necessary OAuth2 invite permission scopes integer is `17067072`.

   * Enable the "server members intent" for your bot, as shown [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intents.html#privileged-intents).

2. Setup and get an API token for the CS:GO League [web API](https://github.com/csgo-league/csgo-league-web) along with the host base URL.

3. Install libpq-dev with `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev`. This is needed to install the psycopg2 Python package.

4. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the repository's root directory to get the necessary libraries.

5. Install PostgreSQL 9.5 or higher with `sudo apt-get install postgresql`.

6. Run the psql tool with `sudo -u postgres psql` and create a database by running the following commands:

    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE csgoleague WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
    CREATE DATABASE csgoleague OWNER csgoleague;
    ```

    Be sure to replace `'yourpassword'` with your own desired password.

7. Create an environment file named `.env` with in the repository's root directory. Fill this template with the requisite information you've gathered:

    ```ini
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=B0tT0k3nFr0mD3v3l0p3rP0rtal

    CSGO_LEAGUE_API_KEY=W3bAP1K3y  # From web php.env file
    CSGO_LEAGUE_API_URL=https://MyCSGOLeagueWebsite.com

    POSTGRESQL_USER=csgoleague
    POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=YourPassword  # SET YOUR OWN PASSWORD DO NOT USE THIS
    POSTGRESQL_DB=csgoleague
    POSTGRESQL_HOST=127.0.0.1  # 127.0.0.1 if running on the same system as the bot
    ```

    Optionally you may set these environment variables another way.

8. Apply the database migrations by running `python3 migrate.py up`.

9. Run the launcher Python script by calling `python3 launcher.py -e {server ID}`. You will only need to use the `-e` flag when running for the first time to create the emojis in your server (be sure to give the bot the "manage emojis" permission in your server). Look [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-#) for help finding your Discord server's ID.
